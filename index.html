    <h2>About The Image</h2>
    <p>This image was created using ChatGPT-4's Dall E model. The theme of this image is bamboo forest in the rain drawn in water color.
      The purpose of this image was to see how much AI generative art has progressed in the last 2 years. In the earlier stage of AI art,
      it was very easy to identify if an image is made with AI, with characteristics like sharp drawing lines, monotone colorings, and high
      resolution results.

    <p>
      This image however, has shown that AI art has made some progresses. Now, there are imperfections with the way of the bamboo trees are drawn. 
      The colorings has also gotten more "human-like", incorporating different shades of green in it's output and making use of blur to add a touch of
      roughness to the image. The image is not without "flaws", but it is still nonetheless exciting to see how much AI art has improved and how much more it will continue to be in the upcoming years.
